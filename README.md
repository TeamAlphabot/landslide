Landslide and Intensity Prediction System 
Every year 25-50 people die from landslides in the United States of America as per statistics. So as to reduce this number we have come up with this revolutionary LIPS (Landslide and Intensity Prediction System).LIPS model is for the United States, period ,but can be used to tackle the landslides in other countries as well. Working:- In LIPS,through the logistic regression model we analyse the data from the data set that has been brought down from the data hub kaggle.com. The dataset consists of the Geographical position, Population and the Intensity of the landslides in the United States of America from the previous calamities from the years 2007 to 2016 . The above data is analysed to know the intesity of the landslides before they occur.LIPS would prevent any futher fatalities and would give the people enough information about the chances of a landslide in the area they are in beforehand and so they could be well prepared with the equipment and the first aid to face the situation. Also the civil engineers as well as the government could be cautious if they are working in a landslide prone zone.
